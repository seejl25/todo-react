# 📝 React To-Do List App

A simple, responsive to-do list application built with React. Users can add, complete (strike-through), and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in the browser using `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add tasks with a button or by pressing Enter
- 🎯 Mark tasks as completed with a strikethrough
- 🗑️ Delete individual tasks
- 💾 Save tasks automatically using `localStorage`
- 🎨 Stylish UI with icons using Font Awesome
